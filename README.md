# Neural Networks Charity Analysis

## Project Overview

"Neural networks (also known as artificial neural networks, or ANN) are a set of algorithms that are modeled after the human brain. They are an advanced form of machine learning that recognizes patterns and features in input data and provides a clear quantitative output. In its simplest form, a neural network contains layers of neurons, which perform individual computations. These computations are connected and weighed against one another until the neurons reach the final layer, which returns a numerical result, or an encoded categorical result."
